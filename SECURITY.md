## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please follow the guidelines below for reporting it to us.

## Steps:

1. **Use Private Vulnerability Reporting**: We allow users to privately report potential security vulnerabilities. Please use this feature for initial reporting. **Do not open a public issue**.

2. **Initial Contact**: If you cannot use the private vulnerability reporting feature for some reason, email the security team directly at **security@ezenity.com**.

3. **Information Gathering**: When reporting, include as much information as possible. Ideally, use the following format:
    - Brief description of the issue
    - Affected components (API, frontend, etc.)
    - Steps to reproduce
        1. Step one
        2. Step two
        ...
    - Supporting material (logs, screenshots)
4. **Expect a Reply**: You will receive an acknowledgment from the security team within 48 hours of reporting, followed by a more detailed response outlining the next steps.

## Disclosure Policy
  - After the initial report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix.
  - The security team will publicly disclose the issue once it has been resolved, crediting you for the discovery, unless you wish to remain anonymous.
## CodeQL Scans
We use GitHub's CodeQL scanning to identify vulnerabilities automatically. However, this doesn't replace the value of human ethical hacking efforts. We appreciate your responsible disclosure.
